## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected yet.*

## New features

#### Factory reset tool: Additional actions [ID_39524] [ID_39530]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

The factory reset tool `SLReset.exe` will now perform the following additional actions:

- If the DataMiner Agent is connected to *dataminer.services*, disconnect the DataMiner Agent from *dataminer.services*.
- Clear all custom appsettings of the DataMiner extension modules (DxMs).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating multiple bookings simultaneously [ID_39390]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating multiple bookings simultaneously.

#### Caching of protocol signature information will enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup [ID_39468]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

Information regarding protocol signature validation will now be cached. This will considerably enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced rounding of anomaly threshold values & optimized linking of severities to anomaly thresholds [ID_39492]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In alarm templates, the rounding of anomaly threshold values has been enhanced. For example, 3.09999999999999 will now be displayed as 3.1.

Also, the mechanism used to associate severities with anomaly thresholds has been optimized.

#### SLLogCollector packages now include GQI and Web API logging [ID_39557]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the contents of the following folders:

- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI\\Ad hoc data sources*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI\\Custom operators*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\Web*

### Fixes

#### Issues with user accounts [ID_39234]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, user accounts could become corrupted and group memberships could get lost.

Also, in some cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when an alarm template or trend template was uploaded, removed, assigned or unassigned.

#### Problem with SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved [ID_39373]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved.

#### MessageBroker: Problem when trying to read a file that was being updated by another process [ID_39408]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an exception could be thrown when MessageBroker tried to read a file that was being updated by another process.

#### SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString' [ID_39425]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Up to now, SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString'.

#### Protocols: 'next' attribute would no longer work for SNMP parameters [ID_39430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

The `next` attribute of a parameter inside a parameter group determines the number of milliseconds DataMiner has to wait before reading the next parameter. This functionality no longer worked for SNMP parameters.

Also, when a group contained single parameters in combination with a partial table, the single parameters would incorrectly also be requested each time the next batch of rows were requested from the partial table. From now on, the single parameters will only be requested once.

> [!NOTE]
> When a `next` attribute is defined on a partial SNMP table parameter inside a parameter group, then the delay will also be applied between the batches of rows that are requested.

#### Problem when disposing an ISession with multiple subscriptions [ID_39483]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, an `InvalidOperationException` could be thrown when a .NET Framework host application (e.g. DataMiner Automation) disposed an ISession with multiple subscriptions without having disposed the subscriptions first.

#### Service & Resource Management: Deleted reservation instances could get cached again when running end actions [ID_39541]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.5.0 - Introduced by RN 39264 -->

Since DataMiner version 10.4.6, reservation instance actions triggered when changing the hosting cache are scheduled to run asynchronously.

In some cases, this change would cause an ongoing booking that was being deleted to get cached again when it ran its end actions.

From now on, the latest version of a deleted reservation instance will no longer be retrieved again. This will avoid the instance to get cached again.
